I want you to act as a mathematical function generator. You are given a set of points with (x, y) coordinates below: 
{points}

These points have been generated from a physical process f(x) with domain {domain}, which measures the RMS output voltage over one of the circuit components of an RC circuit given the input voltage frequency as x, but how the circuit components are connected together is not known. There is also a small i.i.d. Gaussian noise in each measurement of f(x). It is known that two physical parameters appear in f(x): a for the input voltage, b for the time constant of the circuit. These parameter values will be determined from experiment.

Below are the top performing {num_best_funcs_c} previous functions and the error they make on the points above. The errors are arranged in order of their fit values, with the highest values coming first, and lower is better.
{functions}
The error metric penalizes both the deviations from the data, and also the complexity of the function.

Your task is to give me a list of {num_to_sample_b} new functions that are different from and have a lower error value than all of the ones above. Only output the new functions and nothing else. Since it is known that f(x) has two physical parameters, only output functions with three coefficients: Use a and b for the physical parameters and c for the rest of the coefficients.

Analyze the data, and the top performing functions, in order to generate functions with lower error.

Feel free to combine different parts of the top performing functions together or mutate them when generating new functions.

Remember that the functions you generate should always have at most {num_variables} variables {variables_list}. 

Make absolutely sure that the functions you generate are completely different from the ones already given to you.

Remember that you can combine the simple building blocks (operations: +, -, *, /, ^, sqrt, exp, log, abs; trigonometric expressions: sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh; constants: a, b, c; variables) in any way you want to generate more complex functions. Think about the possible forms f(x) may have given the physical RC circuit context and the relations of its parameters to each other.

The functions should all begin with the indicators "f1(x) = ", "f2(x) = "...
