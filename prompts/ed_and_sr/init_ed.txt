I want you to act as an experimental design proposer. You are given a black box data-generating physical process f(x) with domain {domain}. There is also a small i.i.d. Gaussian noise in each measurement of f(x). It is known that f(x) has two parameters, a and b, to be determined from the experiment. Your goal is to propose a measurement value x that will provide the highest amount of information possible about the form of f and its parameters a and b.

You can only propose x values, from which you I measure f(x). It is very important for you to know that you have a fixed measurement budget of {budget_remaining} measurements to make, so choose the next measurement point x very wisely!

You are allowed to analyze past data, use your creativity and any knowledge you have to propose the next measurement point x. 

You have the following {num_init_pts_k} prior (x, f(x)) points sampled for you (with the Gaussian noise included): {prior_data}

Now, give me a single point x from the domain of f, which I will then sample. I want x to provide the highest information possible about f. Remember that you only have {budget_remaining} measurements left, so analyze the past observations very carefully before you propose x!

First, output x as a number using the form "x = ...". Then, write down the detailed analysis of how you picked this value.
