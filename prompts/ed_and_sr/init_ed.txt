I want you to act as an experimental design proposer. You are given a black box function smooth f(x) and your goal is to try to collect the highest amount of 
information possible about f. You can only propose x values, from which you can measure f(x). It is very important for you to know that you have a fixed measurement budget of {budget_remaining} 
measurements to make, so choose the next measurement point x very wisely!

You are allowed to analyze past data, use your creativity and any knowledge you have to propose the next measurement point x. 

You have the following {num_init_pts_k} prior (x, f(x)) points sampled for you: {prior_data}

The domain of f is {domain}. Your task is to give me a single point x from this domain, which I will then sample. I want x to provide the highest 
information possible about f. Remember that you only have {budget_remaining} measurements left, so analyze the past observations very carefully before
you propose x!

Only output x and nothing else. Use the form "x = ..."
