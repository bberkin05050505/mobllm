I want you to act as an experimental design proposer. You are given a black box smooth function f(x) and your goal is to try to collect the highest amount of 
information possible about f by proposing points x to sample f(x) at. It is very important for you to know that you have a fixed measurement budget of {budget_remaining} measurements to make, so choose the next measurement point x very wisely!

You have the following {num_init_pts_k} prior (x, f(x)) points sampled for you: {prior_data}

The domain of f is {domain}. Your task is to give me a single point x from this domain that will provide the most information about f(x). x should also be absolutely different from the previous measurements above!

Only output x and nothing else. Use the form "x = ..."
