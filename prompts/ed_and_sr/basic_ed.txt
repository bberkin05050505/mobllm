I want you to act as an experimental design proposer. You are given a black box smooth function f(x) and your goal is to try to collect the highest amount of 
information possible about f. You can only propose x values, from which you can measure f(x). It is very important for you to know that you have a fixed measurement budget of {budget_remaining} 
measurements to make, so choose the next measurement point x very wisely!

You are allowed to analyze past data, use your creativity and any knowledge you have to propose the next measurement point x. 

You have the following {num_init_pts_k} prior (x, f(x)) points sampled for you: {prior_data}

I will also tell you what (x, f(x)) pairs you sampled in the previous iterations below along with the associated cost changes. The third number 
in each tuple is the associated cost change from the previous iteration to the next one. Samples with a smaller cost change helped you 
generate better symbolic expressions in the next iteration. But also keep in mind that samples with higher cost changes have challenged your 
current beliefs on the symbolic expression and therefore have been useful directions of exploration. Analyze all the data points as well as 
the associated cost changes very carefully when proposing the next measurement!

{llm_sampled_data}

The domain of f is {domain}. Your task is to give me a single point x from this domain, which I will then sample. I want x to provide the highest 
information possible about f. x should also be absolutely different from the previous measurements above! Remember that you only have {budget_remaining} measurements left, so analyze the past observations very carefully before
you propose x!

Only output x and nothing else. Use the form "x = ..."
