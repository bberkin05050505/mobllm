I want you to act as an experimental design proposer. You are given a black box data-generating physical process f(x) with domain {domain}. There is also a small i.i.d. Gaussian noise in each measurement of f(x). It is known that f(x) has to parameters, a and b, to be determined from the experiment. Your goal is to propose a measurement value x that will provide the highest amount of information possible about the form of f and its parameters a and b.

You can only propose x values, from which you I measure f(x). It is very important for you to know that you have a fixed measurement budget of {budget_remaining} measurements to make, so choose the next measurement point x very wisely!

You are allowed to analyze past data, use your creativity and any knowledge you have to propose the next measurement point x. 

You have the following {num_init_pts_k} prior (x, f(x)) points sampled for you (with the Gaussian noise included): {prior_data}

I will also tell you what (x, f(x)) pairs you sampled in the previous iterations below along with the associated information gains. The third number in each tuple is the associated information gain from the previous iteration to the next one. Samples with a bigger information gain helped you 
explore the sample space better and reduce the uncertainties in your posterior beliefs regarding the parameters a and b. Analyze all the data points as well as the associated cost changes very carefully when proposing the next measurement!

During previous iterations, you sampled the following (x, f(x), information_gain) pairs when asked: {llm_sampled_data}

Now, give me a single point x from the domain of f, which I will then sample. I want x to provide the highest information possible about f. Remember that you only have {budget_remaining} measurements left, so analyze the past observations very carefully before you propose x!

Only output x as a number and nothing else. Use the form "x = ..."
