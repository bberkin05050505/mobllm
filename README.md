# LLMs for BED and SR

Framework for incorporating LLMs into intelligent model building by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge to perform efficient BED and SR.

The starting code is from the repo: git@github.com:merlerm/In-Context-Symbolic-Regression.git. They have nice, automated, modular workflows that can be built on for structuring our pipeline.
