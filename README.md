# mobllm: Model Building LLMs via Symbolic Regression and Experimental Design

## Thesis code release

Framework for incorporating LLMs into compact model building by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge to perform experimental design and symbolic regresssion concurrently.

Each experiment has its own associated branch. Running main.py at each branch should run the experiment. To change some parameters and set the root directory as well as the results directory, please see config.yaml.

The codebase on which this code builds is from this repo: git@github.com:merlerm/In-Context-Symbolic-Regression.git.
